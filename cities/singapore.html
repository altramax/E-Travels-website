                            Singapore is famous for being a global financial center,
                             being among the most densely populated places in the world, having a world-class city airport
                              with a waterfall, and a Botanic Garden that is a World Heritage Site.
                            Singapore is known as a tourist destination and for its hot and humid climate,
                             being very clean, and growing in area due to reclaimed land.
                            The city-state is a shopper's paradise, besides the usual luxury brands sold in luxurious malls with
                             luxury air conditioning, you can buy almost everything except chewing gum. Singapore is also known
                              as "Instant Asia" because it offers visitors a quick glimpse of the Asian cultures that immigrants
                               have brought from all parts of the continent.</p>

                            Clarke Quay along the Singapore River is a place dotted with numerous places to spend
                             your evenings. Looking for a pub that serves authentic American spirits or a microbrewery
                              with its own range of beers? You’ll find it all here. The nightlife is varied and never-ending,
                               ranging from quiet spots for intimate conversation to nightclubs that simply explode with sound.
                                There’s also themed parties, night shows, boutique shops and an eclectic mix of patrons.</p>

                            Marina Bay, with its astounding landscape, is considered the most sophisticated and beautiful place
                             on the island. The Marina Bay Sands dominates the view with a triple tower hotel and the breathtaking
                              broadside of the rooftop Skypark that connects three separate mega structures at the 57th floor.
                               There is a spectacular light show at eight in the evening here. The sights include the beautiful
                                Esplanade theater complex and the ArtScience Museum.</p>

                            The world’s largest observation wheel, the Singapore Flyer, is 30 meters taller than the London
                             Eye and has a diameter of 150 meters. Make two trips – one during the day and one at night – to
                              appreciate the view of Singapore’s downtown fully from up in the sky. Visitors have yet to decide
                               which one is more spectacular.</p>

                            A huge colorful and futuristic design, the Gardens by the Bay is one of the prime attractions of
                             Singapore. The Supertree structure created provides the skywalk experience of a lifetime. Two
                              oversized greenhouses create environments for the plants and fauna housed within, and will leave
                               travelers with the distinct impression of having wandered into another world altogether.</p>

                              by the building’s shape is the centerpiece of a place filled with many notable attractions. Check

                            Built in 2002 at a cost of $600 million, this eye-catching complex is located on the bay,
                             directly next to the Marina Bay Sands. It comprises eight main attractions, including a theater
                              to seat 2,000 people and a 1,600-seat concert hall. There are also a number of smaller halls and
                               studios for niche and private performances. It is known locally as ‘The Durian’ (jackfruit)
                                because of its resemblance to the local – and famously pungent – tropical fruit.</p>
