                    <p>It is a common misconception that Zanzibar is just one island. In fact, it is an archipelago of islands located in the Indian Ocean. There are several smaller islands and two larger ones; these are Unguja (colloquially known as Zanzibar), and Pemba Island. Further south is Mafia Island, which is part of Tanzania’s Mafia Archipelago. The total population of Zanzibar is around 1.3 million people.</p>
                <h3>Highlights of the Zanzibar Tour</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The pristine white beaches and blue waters of Zanzibar have a natural connection to the soul and it’s often said that you could see the very bottom of the water due to it being so clean.</li>
                        <li>Zanzibar is home to the red colobus monkey, the Zanzibar servaline genet, and the Zanzibar leopard. The red colobus monkey is an endangered species, and its population is still decreasing. These amazing primates can usually be found in the Jozani Forest, one of the many tourist attractions on the island.</li>
                        <li>If you love the active nightlife, then visiting Zanzibar should excite you. On this tour, you will enjoy five days of incredible nightlife with the locals in various destinations. You will be thrilled to listen to their beautiful and melodious music, dance to their local melodies, and engage in other fun-filled activities.</li>
                        <li>If nature is your thing, then there's no ending to beautiful sights and wonders of creation deposited in Zanzibar.</li>
