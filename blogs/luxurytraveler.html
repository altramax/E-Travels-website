                    <p>If you’re talking about pictures that speak vibrance, positive energy, and adventure, head to @justintensitysworld on Instagram for an amazing time scrolling through the world. </p>
                    <p>Justin is a blogger, luxury traveller, adventurer & lifestyle influencer on social media. Granted the opportunity to have a chat with him, here are his answers to a couple of our questions. </p>
         <h3>Where was the first place you travelled that made you feel - wow travel is amazing?</h3>
         <p> I got the travel bug pretty early in life as a kid travelling with my family. The special place that had me in awe is the Maasai Mara in Kenya — the single greatest place to go on a Safari in the world. It remains my favourite place on planet earth and I’ve been on Safari there probably thirty plus times now.</p>
           <h3>If you had unlimited resources, what would you do and where would you go?</h3>
           <p>I would probably still be a lawyer because I love my job, but I’d run my own firm and keep my own schedule— that way, I could incorporate a lot more travel into my annual schedule. My number one priority would be to travel to as many African countries as possible, starting with Mauritius.</p>     
           <h3>What inspired you to travel for an extended period of time or live in a new country?</h3>
           <p>I’ve twice travelled for an extended period. I’m currently 8 months into a 12-month Hawaii stay. Generally, I’m a big believer in acquiring knowledge through experience. I’m a student of the world and I love learning about different cultures. I think it fosters tolerance, understanding, and togetherness.</p>
        <h3>I travel because…</h3>
        <p>I want to learn as much as I can about all the different and amazing things the world has to offer.</p>
