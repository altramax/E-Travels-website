                        Justin is a blogger, luxury traveller, adventurer & lifestyle influencer on social media.
                         Granted the opportunity to have a chat with him, here are his answers to a couple of our questions. </p>
                <h3 class="offers-heading--sub">Where was the first place you travelled that made you feel - wow travel is amazing?</h3>
                <p class="offers-text text">
                    I got the travel bug pretty early in life as a kid travelling with my family.
                     The special place that had me in awe is the Maasai Mara in Kenya — the single greatest place to go on a Safari
                      in the world. It remains my favourite place on planet earth and I’ve been on Safari there probably thirty plus times now.</p>
                <h3 class="offers-heading--sub">If you had unlimited resources, what would you do and where would you go?</h3>
                <p class="offers-text text">
                    I would probably still be a lawyer because I love my job,
                     but I’d run my own firm and keep my own schedule— that way, I could incorporate
                      a lot more travel into my annual schedule. My number one priority would be to travel
                       to as many African countries as possible, starting with Mauritius.</p>     
                <h3 class="offers-heading--sub">What inspired you to travel for an extended period of time or live in a new country?</h3>
                <p class="offers-text text">
                    I’ve twice travelled for an extended period. I’m currently 8 months into a 12-month Hawaii stay.
                     Generally, I’m a big believer in acquiring knowledge through experience. I’m a student of the world
                      and I love learning about different cultures. I think it fosters tolerance, understanding, and togetherness.</p>
                <h3 class="offers-heading--sub">I travel because…</h3>
                <p class="offers-text text">
                    I want to learn as much as I can about all the different and amazing things the world has to offer.</p>
