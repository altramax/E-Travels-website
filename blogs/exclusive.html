                          <h3>What do you do?</h3>
                            <p>I am on my way to discover inner peace and serenity.</p>
                          <h3>When and how did you develop an interest in travel?</h3> 
                            <p>Since childhood, I think. I was always interested in our planet and read a lot about countries, marine life, and wild animals.</p> 
                          <h3> What are you most passionate about when you travel?</h3>
                            <p>The ultimate freedom to find new adventures. I always prefer to come to places with unimaginable nature. Sometimes I can’t believe that this beauty is real. I like to speak to local people. They always know some cool stories and can tell about their everyday life.
                            And animals…! I was kissed by a cheetah on Zanzibar, fed a white lion, lived on a ranch, and saw hundreds of dolphins in the Atlantic. I have just returned from Maldives where I was accidentally lucky to swim with the whale shark. On this trip, I spent a huge amount of time underwater.</p>
